## Do First
- Check how to listen to the response box within the experiment
- Update the code to collect the time of response
- Also collect the button that is pressed
- Check if we need to send a trigger to the MEG computer, or if that is already being recorded

## Code Structure
- CreateStim.m Only creates the tones, without noise DONE
- RunBlock.m Runs a stimulation block:
    Starts with a ramp of noise DONE
    
    For each trial:
    - PlayPair.m DONE
        Plays a pair of tones with noise in the background
    - Sent event to MEG
    - Listen for behavioral response
    - Record pupil data (or send event to eyelink?)

    Plays noise until the next pair
